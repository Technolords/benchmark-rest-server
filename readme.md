# Rest server benchmarks

## Introduction
As the open source communities move forward, and new libraries are created, it raises
some questions:
- Are we re-inventing the wheel?
- Which library is the most efficient (performance wise)?
- Which library is the most friendly (developer wise)?

This project will implement some rest services, using different implementation stacks.
In order to make a meaningful comparison, a single API method will be implemented
for all of them.
